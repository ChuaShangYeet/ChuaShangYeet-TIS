Reflection:

I feel that visiting NALI 2023 and the interview session helped us learn the course material better. The reasons are to gain more exclusive knowledge in communication and information technology after visiting different booths with different products. Besides, during the interview session,we will learn more about the developer’s perspective on their own product and its main purpose which will give us inspiration for creating and designing our own product in the education industry.

[Design Thinking Project.pdf](https://github.com/ChuaShangYeet/ChuaShangYeet/files/14067111/Design.Thinking.Project.pdf)

Reflection:

The goal regarding the technology and information system I want to know what I can be and what problems or challenges I will face in the future so I can be well-prepared to go into the industry.
From the design thinking project, I know that there are some problems that may still be undiscovered by the developer or programmer that will affect the satisfaction of the users while using the application and browsing the website. Therefore, I could discover the problem and design a plan to solve it with my fellow team members. The design thinking assignment taught me how to communicate with the team members and think critically to solve problems with ease. As a result, I learned to communicate with my future colleagues and solve problems as a team.
I need to study my course synchronously and asynchronously hard to sharpen my skill as a programmer or a developer of websites and applications, so I have the skill to face a variety of challenges in the industry.
